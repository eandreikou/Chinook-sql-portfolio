## Insights
- **Monthly Revenue:** Revenue typically fluctuates over time; peaks and dips are common and may reflect release cycles, seasonality, or campaigns.
- **Running Total & 3-Month MA:** The cumulative line shows overall growth pace, while the 3-month moving average oscillates between ~36â€“48, indicating episodic demand rather than a persistent trend.
- **Top Customers:** A small portion of customers  contributes a disproportionately large share of revenue. Prioritizing these accounts can have outsized impact.
- **AOV (Average Order Value):** The AOV is 5.65, providing a baseline â€˜typical order sizeâ€™ to monitor over time; shifts may signal changes in pricing, bundling, or customer mix.
- **RFM:** Customers with high Monetary and recent activity are prime targets for upsell/retention, while long-inactive customers indicate reactivation opportunities.
- **Revenue by Genre:** Revenue is concentrated in Rock, Latin, and Metal, which are the top-performing genres by sales. Curated recommendations and bundles can help monetize the tail.
